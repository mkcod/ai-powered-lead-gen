# AI-Powered Lead Generation System Prototype

## 1. System Architecture Overview

The prototype will integrate these core components:
- Website visitor tracking
- LinkedIn engagement monitoring
- Lead qualification against ICP
- Automated outreach sequencing
- Meeting scheduling
- Monitoring and optimization

## 2. Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Deploy Website Visitor Tracking

**Setup:**
1. Install Matomo (open-source analytics)
   - Download from [matomo.org](https://matomo.org)
   - Self-host on your server or use cloud version with free tier
   - Add tracking code to your website

2. Set up IP-to-Company resolution
   - Use free tier of Clearbit Reveal API or IPinfo's Company data
   - Create webhook that triggers when new visitors are detected

3. Create lead database
   - Set up Airtable (free tier) or NocoDB (open-source Airtable alternative)
   - Create "Leads" table with fields: 
     - Company name
     - Industry
     - Company size
     - Visit timestamp
     - Pages viewed
     - Source
     - Status

4. Configure n8n (open-source automation)
   - Self-host n8n or use free cloud trial
   - Create workflow: Matomo → IP lookup → Lead database

**Expected Output:** Visitors to your website automatically appear in your lead database with company information.

### Step 2: Monitor LinkedIn Engagement

**Setup:**
1. Create manual tracking process (free alternative to Teamfluence)
   - Set up daily LinkedIn notifications
   - Export LinkedIn activity data (profile views, post interactions)

2. Build simple LinkedIn scraper (optional, advanced)
   - Use Puppeteer or Playwright (open-source) to automate data collection
   - Schedule daily runs to extract connection requests, profile views

3. Configure n8n workflow
   - Trigger: Manual CSV upload or scraper output
   - Action: Add engagement data to lead database
   - Filter: Flag high-intent signals (direct messages, profile views)

**Expected Output:** Daily list of LinkedIn prospects who engaged with your profile or content.

### Step 3: Qualify Leads Against ICP

**Setup:**
1. Define your Ideal Customer Profile
   - Document target industries, company sizes, roles, technologies
   - Create scoring system (1-5) for each ICP attribute

2. Implement enrichment process
   - Use free tier of Hunter.io or Clearbit for basic enrichment
   - Or use open-source tools like EmailFinder or EmailHarvester

3. Create qualification formula in Airtable/NocoDB
   - Score leads based on ICP match (formula field)
   - Auto-categorize as "Cold," "Warm," or "Hot" based on score
   - Set up views to filter leads by qualification status

**Expected Output:** Scored and filtered lead list with highest-potential prospects highlighted.

### Step 4: Automate Outreach Sequences

**Setup:**
1. Set up email outreach
   - Use free tier of Mailchimp, SendGrid, or self-hosted Mautic (open-source)
   - Create templates for initial outreach and 2-3 follow-ups
   - Personalize using {{company}}, {{name}}, and {{custom_field}} variables

2. Set up LinkedIn outreach (manual-assisted)
   - Create template messages for connection requests and follow-ups
   - Use Chrome extensions like LinkedHelper (free trial) 
   - For fully free: Use n8n to generate daily outreach task list

3. Configure integration
   - n8n workflow: When lead scores above threshold → Add to outreach sequence
   - Trigger follow-up based on engagement (opened email, viewed LinkedIn)

**Expected Output:** Semi-automated outreach system that sends personalized emails and LinkedIn messages to qualified leads.

### Step 5: Scheduling & Calendar Integration

**Setup:**
1. Deploy Cal.com (open-source)
   - Self-host or use free cloud tier
   - Connect to your Google Calendar
   - Set up availability and meeting types (15min, 30min, 60min)

2. Create scheduling links
   - Generate unique links for different campaigns
   - Add UTM parameters for tracking source

3. Integrate with outreach
   - Include calendar link in email templates and LinkedIn messages
   - Set up webhook: When meeting booked → Update lead status in database

**Expected Output:** Frictionless scheduling system where prospects can book meetings directly on your calendar.

### Step 6: Monitoring & Optimization

**Setup:**
1. Build simple dashboard
   - Use Google Data Studio (free) or Metabase (open-source)
   - Connect to your lead database

2. Track core KPIs
   - Website traffic and bounce rate (from Matomo)
   - Email open and reply rates
   - LinkedIn response rates
   - Meetings booked/attended
   - Conversion through funnel stages

3. Set up alerts
   - Configure n8n to send Slack/email notifications for key events:
     - New qualified lead added
     - Lead responds to outreach
     - Meeting scheduled

**Expected Output:** Clear visibility into system performance with actionable metrics.
